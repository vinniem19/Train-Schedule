# Train-Schedule
This is an applcation that uses firebase as a server to save and retrieve data.  

This app lets a user fill out a form about train data: 
- Name of train
- City or Destination
- First train arrival
- Frequency of arrival

With that information, the app retrieves information from the database, makes some calculations, and displays for the user:
- Name of train
- City or Destination
- Next train arrival time
- Number of minutes until the next train arrives
